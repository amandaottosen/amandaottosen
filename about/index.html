          <h1>Well, hello!</h1>
          <p>I grew up in Helena, Montana with my wonderful family: a great older brother and both of my loving parents. My parents and I moved out to Bremerton, Washington when I was 14, which was hard at first, but we all love living in this area - it's absolutely beautiful!<br>I met my incredible husband while I was in college - we actually met online! It was love at first site (I know, I know... but it's true!). I was lucky enough to marry that man in May of 2017 and it has been so great! We have two kitties together who are both still pretty young and definitely keep us on our toes! We love them, and are really enjoying married life together.</p>
          <p>Alright, enough of that sappy stuff! Backtracking a little, after I graduated high school, I immediately went to college to study Biology. I was focused on my goal of going to Medical School and everything seemed to center around that at the time. As I was finishing my degree, I realized that being a doctor was not the right career choice for me - mostly because I saw a cadaver and it freaked me out <em>way</em> more than I expected! I continued studying Biology and got my degree, but have been looking for a career choice I would really like.<br><br></p>
          <p><strong>Enter: web development.</strong><br><br>I took an intro Java coding course in my undergrad studies and found I liked it. So, when I was looking for a new career, I stumbled upon web development and absolutely fell in love with it. I got enough funding together and signed up for a "coding bootcamp" with Skillcrush. It has been an absolute blast! It constantly challenges me and gives me an actual rush when I get a something to work and look like I want it to - it's so fun!<br><br>I would love to work with you to make your site everything you want it to be! Connect with me and let's get started!
